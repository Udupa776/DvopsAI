🚀 Autonomous CI/CD Healing Agent – RIFT 2026

An AI-powered DevOps agent that autonomously detects, fixes, and verifies code failures in CI/CD pipelines using a multi-agent architecture.
The system clones a GitHub repository, runs tests, identifies issues (linting, syntax, logic, type errors, imports), and generates targeted fixes.
It commits changes with the [AI-AGENT] prefix, creates a properly formatted branch, and iterates until all tests pass.
A production-ready React dashboard visualizes failures, fixes, CI/CD timelines, and scoring breakdown in real time.
Built for the RIFT 2026 AIML Track to reduce debugging time and enable fully autonomous pipeline healing
